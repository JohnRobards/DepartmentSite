          <h2>Undergraduate Program</h2>
          <p>The department conducts a survey of all graduating economics majors and minors at the time of graduation.  A key focus of this survey is on job placements and plans for post-graduate education.  While many students have not yet formalized their plans at the time of graduation, the majority of students have either decided on a job or additional schooling, and the information for these students is summarized below.  You can also refer to the “Outcomes for 2011 Graduating Majors…” link above.  In the last academic year, there were 120 economics majors (and 29 economics minors).  Of the 120 majors, we received 71 responses to the survey.  Of the 71 who responded, 22 had accepted a job, 21 were heading off to post-graduate training and 26 were either engaged in the job search or were uncertain of their plans. </p>
          <p>Of the 22 who had accepted a job, far and away the most common job title was “analyst.”   Some students gave additional information, including “financial analyst,” “business analyst” and “technology analyst,” with the most common description being financial analyst.  A number of other students were moving on to positions in consulting.  Students also reported such job titles as integration specialist in marketing, fixed income associate, business management associate, productions associate, assistant fashion merchandiser, and research assistant.   Many students accepted jobs at well known companies, including Analysis Group, Wells Fargo, General Mills, Pricewaterhouse Coopers, Oppenhiemer, Google, Goldman Sachs, Bain & Co., Accenture, Deloitte, Capital One, Credit Suisse, Morningstar and Morgan Stanley.  Other employers include The Tobin Project, Charles River Associates, NISA Investment Advisors, LLC., Cornerstone Research, Thammasat University College of Innovation, School for Field Studies (Mexico), and Seoul National University Brain Imaging Center.   The median salary was roughly $57,000.</p>
          <p>Of the 21 economics majors heading off to graduate school, one was going to law school, three were attending medical school, and five were seeking Ph.D.s in economics.  In addition, other students entered Master’s programs in Economics, Finance, Business, Public Health and Environmental Sciences.  Post-graduate schools selected by our majors include Duke University, Columbia University, Northwestern University, Sydney University, London School of Economics, University College of London, and Washington University, to name a few.</p>
          <p>The outcomes for our 2011 graduates mirror the weaker job market:  compared to the 2006-2008 periods, a somewhat larger fraction were still looking for a job at the time of graduation, or had uncertain plans.  Overall, however, the outcomes for our 2011 graduating majors are similar to 2010 and better than 2009.  We are very pleased – particularly in this challenging economic environment – that most students continue to find good starting jobs or attractive opportunities for post graduate training.</p>
